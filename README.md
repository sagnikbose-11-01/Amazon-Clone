# Amazon-Clone

This project is a frontend clone of the Amazon website, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It aims to replicate the look and feel of the Amazon website while also implementing responsive design principles for optimal viewing across various devices. It is designed to emulate the layout and features of the Amazon homepage to demonstrate frontend web development skills.

## Features

- **Header**: Includes navigation links, search bar, and account options similar to the original Amazon home page.
- **Product sections**: Displays various product categories with images, titles, and prices.
- **Product carousel**: Implements a carousel/slider feature for showcasing featured products or deals.
- **Image slider with mouse scrolling**: Incorporates an image slider feature that allows users to navigate through images by scrolling with the mouse wheel. This intuitive navigation enhances the user experience by providing a dynamic and interactive way to view content.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

- **Product Details**: Users can view detailed information about products, including images, descriptions, pricing, and customer ratings.

- **Shopping Cart**: The website incorporates a shopping cart functionality where users can view the items they've added, along with a "Proceed to Checkout" button and the subtotal of their selections. The shopping cart page can be accessed via the cart icon on the navigation bar.

- **Sign In and Sign Up**: The website offers frontend layouts for both the sign-in and sign-up pages, with direct access to the sign-in page from the navigation bar. Moreover, clicking the "Create your Amazon account" button below the sign-in section directs users to the sign-up section. Conversely, clicking the "Login with Amazon account" button below the sign-up section redirects users back to the sign-in page.
